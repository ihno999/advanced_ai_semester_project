{"context": "Ihno awakens in a dark forest. A mysterious figure approaches.\n\nThe figure, cloaked and hooded, extends a bony hand towards you. A low, raspy voice whispers, \"Lost, little one? I can offer guidance, for a price.\" The glint of gold catches your eye as the figure reveals a small pouch. The air grows heavy, and the scent of damp earth fills your nostrils. Do you accept their offer, or refuse?\n``\n\nThe figure chuckles, its breath like the rustling of dead leaves.
