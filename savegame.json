{"context": "Ihno awakens in a dark forest. A mysterious figure approaches.\n\nThe figure, cloaked and hooded, stops before you. A raspy voice whispers, \"Lost, little one? This forest demands a toll for passage.\" He extends a skeletal hand, palm up. Do you offer him something, or draw your wooden stick?\n``\n\nThe figure chuckles, a dry, rattling sound. \"Foolishness.\" Before you can fully raise the stick, he swipes, a gust of wind knocking you off your feet. As you fall, you notice a faint shimmer around his hand. Will you try to get back up immediately or feign unconsciousness?\n``\n\nYou scramble back to your feet, wooden stick raised defensively. The figure's hood shifts, revealing a glimpse of glowing red eyes. \"Brave, but ill-prepared,\" he rasps. He lunges with surprising speed, his hand outstretched again. Do you attempt to strike first, or dodge his attack?\n\n``\n\nYou nimbly sidestep, narrowly avoiding his grasp. The air crackles where his hand passed, and you feel a chill despite the exertion. He stumbles slightly, recovering his balance, and his eyes glow more fiercely. Do you attack while he is off balance, or retreat to gain some distance?\n\nYou swing the wooden stick with all your might, connecting with a sickening thud against the figure's shoulder. He recoils, a pained hiss escaping his lips. A dark purple ichor begins to seep from the wound. He glares at you, malice burning in his crimson eyes, and raises his hand again. Do you attempt to disarm him, or press the attack?\n\n``\n\nWith renewed vigor, you slam the wooden stick down on his outstretched hand. A sickening *crack* echoes in the chamber as his fingers bend at unnatural angles. He roars in pain, clutching his mangled hand to his chest. Seizing the opportunity, you prepare to land a decisive blow. Where do you aim your final attack - his head, or his chest?\n\n```json\n\n```\n\nYou bring the wooden stick down with a ferocious strike, impacting squarely on the creature's skull. The sound is sickeningly hollow, and the figure collapses in a heap, the purple ichor pooling around its lifeless form. The glow fades from its eyes, leaving only empty sockets. The air grows still and the crackling subsides. Do you search the creature's body or explore the rest of the room?\n\n``\n\nAs you rummage through the creature's tattered rags, you find a small pouch containing five gold coins. Clutched tightly in its mangled hand is a tarnished silver ring. It appears to be inscribed with strange symbols. Do you try to decipher the symbols or pocket the ring and move on?\n\n``\n\n\u274c Error parsing meta update: Expecting value: line 1 column 10 (char 9)", "game_memory": ["Ihno awakens in a dark forest.
