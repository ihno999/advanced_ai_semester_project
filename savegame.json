{"context": "Ihno awakens in a dark forest. A mysterious figure approaches.\n\nThe figure, cloaked and hooded, stops before you. A raspy voice whispers, \"Lost, little one? The woods hold secrets, and dangers aplenty. Turn back now, or pay the price.\" His skeletal hand emerges from the cloak, offering a tarnished silver amulet.\n\n``\n\nThe figure chuckles, a dry, rattling sound. He snatches the coins, his eyes glinting in the dim light. \"A fair price,\" he croaks, dropping the amulet into your outstretched hand. \"May it protect you from what lies ahead.\" He melts back into the shadows, leaving you alone once more.\n\n``\n\nThe wooden stick feels surprisingly sturdy in your grip. A low growl echoes from the dense undergrowth. Two glowing red eyes pierce the darkness, followed by the snapping of twigs. A mangy wolf, teeth bared, lunges from the trees!\n\n``\n\nYour makeshift weapon connects with a satisfying *thwack*! The wolf yelps, stumbling back, momentarily stunned. It shakes its head, more enraged than before. Blood trickles from the fresh wound as it circles, waiting for its opportunity to strike.\n\n``\n\nYour fists fly, connecting with the wolf's snout and ribs. The beast snarls, momentarily disoriented, but retaliates with a swift bite to your arm! Pain shoots up your limb as its teeth tear through your tunic. It leaps back, savoring its advantage.\n\n``\n\nYou grapple with the snarling wolf, your hands finding purchase around its neck. It claws and snaps, desperate to escape your hold. With a surge of strength, you squeeze, cutting off its air. The wolf thrashes wildly, then slowly weakens. Finally, its struggles cease, and it collapses to the ground.\n\n``\n\nA low growl rumbles from the shadows behind you. Two more pairs of glowing eyes emerge, their owners eager to avenge their fallen packmate. These wolves look bigger, more menacing than the first. Their fangs are bared, and their muscles are tensed, ready to pounce.\n\n``\n\nYou lunge, meeting one wolf head-on. Your fist connects with its jaw, but the other circles, nipping at your heels. The first wolf retaliates, raking its claws across your chest. You stumble back, momentarily stunned.\n\n``\n\n\u274c Error parsing meta update: Expecting value: line 1 column 25 (char 24)", "game_memory": ["Ihno awakens in a dark forest.
