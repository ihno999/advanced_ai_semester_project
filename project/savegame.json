{"context": "Ihno awakens in a dark forest. A mysterious figure approaches.\n\nThe figure, cloaked and hooded, stops a few feet away. His face is obscured by shadow, but you sense a deep weariness in his posture. He speaks in a raspy voice, \"Lost, are you? This forest... it doesn't give up its secrets easily.\" He pauses, then asks, \"What brings you to this forsaken place?\"\n\nThe figure chuckles, a dry, rustling sound. \"Treasure, eh? Many have sought it here, and few have returned. This forest is guarded by more than just trees and shadows. Beware the Whispering Caves to the north; they hold both great riches and terrible dangers. Will you brave the caves, or seek your fortune elsewhere?\"\n\nThe figure nods slowly. \"The Whispering Caves it is, then. Head north, but be warned: the air itself seems to whisper lies within those tunnels. Trust your instincts, not your ears.\" He points a gnarled finger in the direction of a barely visible path. \"Do you equip your sword and torch, or proceed as you are?\"\n\nYou heft the Wooden Sword, its grip surprisingly comfortable. With the torch in your other hand, the forest path ahead flickers with dancing shadows. The air grows noticeably colder as you step onto the path. Will you proceed cautiously, or charge ahead?\n\nWith the Wooden Sword in your right hand and the torch in your left, the flickering light dances across the path, revealing gnarled roots and damp earth. The air grows heavy, a strange silence pressing in around you, broken only by the distant sound of dripping water. As you move forward, you notice an ominous pile of bones near a darkened cave entrance. Do you investigate the bones or cautiously enter the cave?\n\n``\n\nKneeling by the pile of bones, you notice they are not animal remains, but humanoid, and disturbingly small. A glint of metal catches your eye beneath the skeletal heap. It looks like a small, tarnished dagger. Do you pocket the dagger or examine the cave entrance more closely?", "game_memory": ["Ihno awakens in a dark forest.
