{"context": "Ihno awakens in a dark forest. A mysterious figure approaches.\n\nThe figure, cloaked and hooded, stops a few feet away. A raspy voice emerges from the shadows, \"Lost, are we? Or perhaps... looking for something?\" He gestures vaguely with a gnarled hand. Do you trust this individual and share your purpose, or remain guarded?\n\nThe figure chuckles, a dry, rustling sound. \"Treasure, is it? Many seek it, few find it. The forest demands a price for its secrets.\" He pauses, his unseen eyes seeming to bore into you. \"Tell me, what are you willing to offer for a clue?\"\n\nHe considers your offer, then rasps, \"Two gold is... acceptable. Follow the path east, until you reach the ruins. Beware the guardians of the old stones, for they are not welcoming.\" He melts back into the shadows, leaving you alone on the path. Do you heed his warning and venture east, or do you distrust his words and search elsewhere?\n\nThe familiar weight of the Wooden Sword feels slightly reassuring in your hand. The path east winds deeper into the woods, the air growing heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. The silence is broken only by the occasional snap of a twig underfoot. Do you proceed cautiously, or press forward with haste?\n\n``\n\nThe torch sputters to life, casting dancing shadows that illuminate the path ahead. The ruins loom in the distance, their silhouettes stark against the twilight sky. A low growl echoes from within. Do you approach with sword drawn and torch held high, or attempt to scout the ruins from a distance?\n\n``\n\nAs you approach the ruins, two hulking figures emerge from the shadows. Their eyes glow with an eerie red light, and gnarled, stone-like hands clench menacingly. One of the guardians lunges towards you with surprising speed, while the other remains rooted to the spot, its gaze fixed upon you. Do you stand your ground and fight, or attempt to retreat back into the forest?\n\n``\n\nYou raise your hand and unleash a searing bolt of fire. It strikes the closest guardian, searing its rocky flesh. The creature roars in pain and stumbles back momentarily. Its companion remains unmoved, its eyes burning with cold fury. What is your next action?\n\nYou attempt to cast another Firebolt, but the words feel clumsy, and the energy fizzles out before it can take form. The guardian seizes the opportunity to charge, its stony fist smashing into your chest. The force sends you reeling backward, gasping for breath. What do you do?\n\n``", "game_memory": ["Ihno awakens in a dark forest. A mysterious figure approaches.", "Ihno: ii talk with the man", "The figure, cloaked and hooded, stops a few feet away.
