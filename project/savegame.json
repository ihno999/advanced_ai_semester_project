{"context": "Ihno awakens in a dark forest. A mysterious figure approaches.\n\nThe figure, cloaked and hooded, gestures for silence. A raspy voice whispers, \"The forest answers those who listen. Seek the Whispering Cairns to the north; they hold the key to your destiny, or your doom.\" The figure melts back into the shadows. Do you head north towards the cairns?\n\nYou trudge north, the dim torchlight barely piercing the oppressive gloom. Twisted trees claw at the sky, their branches like skeletal fingers. A rustling in the undergrowth suggests you are not alone. Ahead, two glowing eyes appear in the darkness. What do you do?\n\nThe torch sputters to life in your left hand, revealing a pair of snarling goblins! Their crude clubs are raised, ready to strike. They hiss, \"Stupid human! We take shiny thing!\" Do you attack, or attempt to flee?\n``\n\nYou swing your wooden stick at the first goblin. The stick connects with a satisfying *thwack*. The goblin reels, but remains standing. Enraged, it lunges, club raised high. What do you do next?\n``\n\nYou swing again with the wooden stick, connecting with the goblin's head before it can retaliate. It crumples to the ground. The second goblin, seeing its companion fall, hesitates for a moment, fear flashing in its eyes. Does the remaining goblin flee or attack?\n```json\n\n```\n\n\u274c Error parsing meta update: Invalid JSON format.\n\nYou focus your mind, and a small ball of fire erupts from your outstretched hand, searing the goblin! It shrieks, dropping its club and clutching its smoking arm. However, it doesn't fall. It glares at you with pure hatred. Will you attack again?\n\n`{\"health\": 0, \"gold\": 0, \"xp\": 5, \"inventory_add\": [], \"inventory_remove\": [], \"equip\": {}, \"unequip\": []}`\n\nYou cast another Firebolt, and it hits the goblin squarely in the chest, sending it flying backwards into the cavern wall. It slumps to the ground, unmoving. With the goblins defeated, a small, dusty chest becomes visible in the corner. Do you approach it?\n\n```json\n\n```\n\nThe chest creaks open, revealing a small pile of gold coins and a gleaming dagger with a bone handle. The dagger emanates a faint aura of shadows. Do you take the items?\n\n```json\n{\"health\": 0, \"gold\": 5, \"xp\": 0, \"inventory_add\": [\"Shadow Dagger\"], \"inventory_remove\": [], \"equip\": {}, \"unequip\": []}\n```\n\nYou carefully stow the wooden stick in your pack, its meager usefulness now outstripped. As you grip the Shadow Dagger, a chill runs down your spine. The blade feels unnaturally light, almost as if it's an extension of your own will. With the dagger equipped, you feel slightly stronger! Do you proceed further into the cave?\n\n```json\n{\"health\": 0, \"gold\": 0, \"xp\": 0, \"inventory_add\": [\"Wooden Stick\"], \"inventory_remove\": [], \"equip\": {\"right_hand\": \"Shadow Dagger\"}, \"unequip\": [\"Wooden Stick\"]}\n```\n\nYou quickly stash away the Shadow Dagger into your inventory. The dungeon air feels heavy as you walk deeper. As you venture further, the path splits into two tunnels: one leading downwards, the other continuing straight ahead. Which way do you go?\n\n```json\n{\"health\": 0, \"gold\": 0, \"xp\": 0, \"inventory_add\": [], \"inventory_remove\": [], \"equip\": {\"right_hand\": null}, \"unequip\": [\"Shadow Dagger\"]}\n```\n\nThe familiar weight of the wooden stick settles in your hand. As you equip it, you feel more confident. The tunnels loom ahead, darkness swallowing the light. Will you descend or continue straight?\n\n```json\n{\"health\": 0, \"gold\": 0, \"xp\": 0, \"inventory_add\": [], \"inventory_remove\": [], \"equip\": {\"right_hand\": \"Wooden Stick\"}, \"unequip\": []}\n```\n\nYour fingers fumble for a moment before the stick is safely stowed. The silence of the cavern presses in, broken only by the drip, drip, drip of unseen water. You can almost feel the weight of the darkness in front of you, a tangible presence. Do you dare to descend, or will you brave the path ahead?\n\n```json\n{\"health\": 0, \"gold\": 0, \"xp\": 0, \"inventory_add\": [], \"inventory_remove\": [], \"equip\": {\"right_hand\": null}, \"unequip\": [\"Wooden Stick\"]}\n```", "game_memory": ["Ihno awakens in a dark forest.
